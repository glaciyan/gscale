## Character Images

### Cards

1. Crop the desired image to a size of 480x300
   - (preffered) the face of the character should be positioned on the right side and the face should fill 1/3 of the image height, if the image contains a lot of effects (e.g. Zhongli or Raiden) the face should fill 1/4 of the height
2. Place your cropped image into `src/lib/data/images/characters/card`
3. (optional) Run `npm run make:images` in a command line to build all images into a more optimized version
4. Commit and push your additions into git and create a pull request
